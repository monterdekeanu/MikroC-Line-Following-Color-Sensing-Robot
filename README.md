# MikroC-Line-Following-Color-Sensing-Robot
A line-following and color-sensing robot coded in mikroC and compiled with MPLAB. It uses a TCS34725 color sensor, PIC16F877A microcontroller, L298N motor driver, 3-way IR sensors for line following, and an IR sensor to switch the color sensor on/off. The robot stops on red, goes on green, and reverses on blue.
